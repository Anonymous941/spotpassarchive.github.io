					As you may know, <a class="blue" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/~/announcement-of-discontinuation-of-online-services-for-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u">Nintendo has announced</a> that online services for the Nintendo 3DS, 2DS and Wii U family of systems
					are shutting down in April.
				</p>
				<p>
					All online communication services, including the distribution of <span class="blue">SpotPass</span> data will be discontinued on <span class="yellow">April 8th, 2024, at 4pm PDT</span>. As a result, features using SpotPass in many titles will stop working once this change has taken effect.
				</p>
				<p>
					3DS/2DS and Wii U systems store a local database of titles for which you have recently received SpotPass data. This database can be used to check for the URLs it uses to download the SpotPass content.
				</p>
				<p>
					By dumping this database from your system(s), you can help <span class="purple">Pretendo</span> in preserving SpotPass content, ensuring that SpotPass features in these titles can be used long after Nintendo has pulled the plug on the service. <span class="bold">Database dumps do not contain any personally identifiable information.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="main-block">
				<p>Popular 3DS titles using SpotPass features include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="blue">StreetPass Mii Plaza</span>: SpotPass was used to distribute special Miis (often of Nintendo employees) and puzzle pieces for the Puzzle Swap minigame. Without SpotPass, Puzzle Swap would normally not receive new puzzles.</li>
					<li><span class="blue">Mario Kart 7</span>: SpotPass was used to receive ghost data from other players and Nintendo.</li>
					<li><span class="blue">New Super Mario Bros. 2</span>: SpotPass was used to receive a certain system message allowing the installation of DLC.</li>
					<li><span class="blue">Tomodachi Life</span>: SpotPass was used to distribute special outfits.</li>
					<li><span class="blue">Swapnote</span> and <span class="blue">Swapdoodle</span>: SpotPass was used for sending and receiving notes (including notes from Nintendo).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The way you dump the database depends on your system firmware version and whether or not you have CFW (custom firmware) installed.</p>
				<p>Choose a guide matching your system:</p>

				<h3 class="green">FAQ</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="bold">Q.</span> Apart from dumping my system's SpotPass data, what else can I do to help?
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="bold">A.</span> Spread the word everywhere. For 3DS/Wii U games that have communities or fanbases surrounding them, tell them about the archival project. We only have until <span class="yellow">April 8th</span> to archive as much as we can, so make sure that people understand the urgency of the situation.
				</p><br>
				<p>
					<span class="bold">Q.</span> Which games have SpotPass data archived?
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="bold">A.</span> Check <a class="blue" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qU0o7zxILAZcI83nOidr1QSrM0maVp6OGdBqg0xwul0/htmlview">this spreadsheet</a> to see which games currently have data archived. Do note that if a game is marked as "complete", that does NOT mean that all data for that game has been collected. Rather, it means that <span class="italic">some</span> data for the game has been collected and it may or may not be complete.
				</p><br>
				<p>
					<span class="bold">Q.</span> How do I make sure that [game] has its SpotPass data archived?
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="bold">A.</span> Reach out to others who have played that game, no matter how long ago, and tell them about the archival project and how they can get their data preserved. There's <span class="bold">a lot</span> of games (especially niche games) that don't have SpotPass data archived yet, so it's very important for game communities to know about this in order to ensure that SpotPass data for their game(s) is preserved before it's too late.
